# Building:
#   Load apptainer (or singularity) module as needed.
#   Note that singularity/apptainer are interchangeable in the below commands
#   Navigate to project root
#
# Option 1: Standard build
#   apptainer build --fakeroot --bind $(shell pwd):/workspace hspn.sif cluster/hspn.def
#
# Option 2: In case of memory issues use two-step sandbox build process
#   apptainer build --fakeroot --bind "$(shell pwd):/workspace" --sandbox hspn.sif/ cluster/hspn.def
#   apptainer build --fakeroot hspn.sif hspn.sif/
