# Building:
#   Load apptainer (or singularity) module as needed.
#   Note that singularity/apptainer are interchangeable in the below commands
#   Navigate to project root
#
# Option 1: Standard build
#   singularity build --fakeroot --bind $(shell pwd):/workspace hspn.sif cluster/hspn.def
#
# Option 2: In case of memory issues use two-step sandbox build process
#   singularity build --sandbox --fakeroot --bind $(shell pwd):/workspace hspn.sif cluster/hspn.def
#   singularity build --fakeroot hspn.sif hspn.sif/

# module load singularity && singularity build --fakeroot --bind $(pwd):/workspace hspn.sif cluster/hspn.def
